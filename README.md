# sign-up-form-project



For this project, i will be displaying more advanced css skill that I have learned. I will try to use least amount of fundamental so I know myself that I have gained more knowledge in creating more shiny, beautiful, and sleek design. This one will be hard but I will continue to research and learn new ways of creating CSS.

I will be using intermediate css concepts such as:
 - positioning
 - advanced selectors
 - more text styles
 - more css properties
 - css functions
 - custom propeties
 and some new intermediate HTML concepts such as:
 - form basics and validation
